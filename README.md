# MATSim Rust

This is a port of MATSim to Rust. This project served
as [reference implementation](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/pull/4255) for a distributed version of the QSim
in the MATSim-Java core.

The most recent release can be cited with the following reference

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/498376436.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13928119)

The project is described in a journal publication:

- [High-Performance Mobility Simulation: Implementation of a Parallel Distributed Message-Passing Algorithm for MATSim](https://doi.org/10.3390/info16020116)

And two conference papers, which were presented at ISPDC 24 in Chur, Switzerland, July 2024:

- [High-Performance Simulations for Urban Planning: Implementing Parallel Distributed Multi-Agent Systems in MATSim](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC62236.2024.10705395)
- [Real-Time Routing in Traffic Simulations: A Distributed Event Processing Approach](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC62236.2024.10705399)

## How this project is organized

The project is organized as a cargo workspace with multiple crates. The main crates are:

- `rust-qsim`: The core library containing the simulation logic
- `macros`: The crate containing (test) macros used in the project

Work with the `rust-qsim` crate for the simulation. The other crates are only for development purposes.

Check out further documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Set Up Prerequisites

The project relies on METIS as external dependency. This means this dependency is not
compiled with the project, but need to be present on the operating system.

### METIS

The project uses the [metis](https://crates.io/crates/metis) crate as a dependency which
is a wrapper for the [METIS C Library](https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS). The C-Library is
expected to be present on the machine. Also, the `metis` crate requires `libclang` on the machine
this project is built on.

### MPI -- deprecated

Up to version 0.2.0, the project supported MPI as a feature for distributed execution. We decided to not support MPI
anymore. The code is still present in the repository, but not maintained anymore. If you want to use MPI, please
checkout version 0.2.0 or earlier.

Currently, only Rust's multithreading capabilities are used for parallelism.

### Install dependencies

The dependencies named above need to be installed before the project can be buit

#### Linux - apt

Install dev versions of required packages because dev stuff is required during compilation

```shell
sudo apt -y install libclang-dev llvm-dev libmetis-dev
```

#### macOS

The dependencies are available via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS.

```shell
brew install metis cmake
```

The project contains a `config.toml` which tries to set the `CPATH` and the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable. In case
this doesn't work, they need to be set like the following:

```shell
export CPATH=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/include
export RUSTFLAGS="-L$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib"
```

The variables are necessary to compile the METIS library.

The `CXX` variable may also need to be set for compiling some included dependencies like `protobuf-src`.

```shell
export CXX=clang++
```

#### Math Cluster (TU Berlin)

The math cluster has all dependencies installed. They need to be enabled via the module system:

```shell
module load metis-5.1
```

#### HLRN (CPU-CLX Partition)

https://nhr-zib.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/pages/430586/CPU+CLX+partition

##### Setup conda

Unfortunately, there is no `libclang` dependency installed. You need to install it yourself via `conda`. If you use it
for the first time, load the conda module and initialize it, such that it is available in your shell whenever you login:

```shell
module load anaconda3/2023.09
conda init bash
```

Then create your own environment and install `libclang` and `llvmdev`:

```shell
conda create -n your_env_name
conda activate your_env_name
conda install libclang llvmdev
```

Remember to pass the login at the beginning of SLURM scripts: `#!/bin/bash --login`.

##### Load dependencies

The HLRN cluster has **some** dependencies installed. They need to be enabled via the module system:

```shell
module load intel/2024.2
```

So, before you run the project, you need to activate the environment:

```shell
conda activate your_env_name
```

The activation automatically updates the environment variables such that `libclang` files can be found by the compiler.

#### HLRN (CPU-GENOA Partition)

https://nhr-zib.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/pages/119832634/CPU+Genoa+partition

##### Compilation

In contrast to the CLX partition, you don't need anaconda here. But, you need to compile with AMD compiler.

```shell
module load openmpi/aocc/5.0.3
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
export RUSTFLAGS="-C linker=clang"
```

Hint: You need to set these environment variables, otherwise there are compilation errors (paul, jan'25).
Hint 2: These settings are probably not necessary anymore without MPI usage (paul, sep'25).

##### Execution

For some reason, the runtime linker doesn't find the correct libraries. You need to add them manually before execution (
in the job script):

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/sw/comm/openmpi/5.0.3/genoa.el9/aocc/lib
```

## Build

The project is built using cargo.

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Test

To execute all tests run:

```
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

To have immediate output add `--nocapture` to the command.

Note (Sep 205): The `--test-threads=1` option is used currently to ensure that the global ID store does not get
overwritten by multiple parallel test threads. This will eventually be refined to allow all read-only tests to run in
parallel and forcing sequencial order only for read-write tests.

## Run locally (multithreaded)

Execute

```shell
./target/release/local_qsim --config /path/to/config.yml
```

or

```shell
cargo run --release --bin local_qsim -- --config /path/to/config.yml
```

to run the simulation.

For example, after successfully running the tests first, try

```
cd rust_qsim
cargo run --release --bin local_qsim -- --config tests/resources/equil/equil-config-1.yml
```

## Serve routes to SILO after QSim

With `--routing-service-ready-file`, `local_qsim` keeps its trip router and population alive after
the last iteration and answers route queries over TCP, so SILO can reuse the simulated travel times
for the rest of its year:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin local_qsim -- --config /path/to/config.yml --routing-service-ready-file /path/to/ready
```

The service binds to a free port on `127.0.0.1` and writes its address (for example
`127.0.0.1:41235`) to the ready file once it accepts connections. The process then keeps serving
until it is killed.

The config must list the modes to route in `routing.network_modes` (for example `[ "car" ]`).
Without it no network router exists: QSim stops in prepare-for-sim for plans with network legs,
and route requests for that mode fail with `invalid_request`. QSim also scores every plan, so
`scoring` needs parameters for each activity type, mode, and subpopulation in the population.

The protocol is line-delimited JSON: one request object per line, one response object per line.

```json
{"mode": "car", "from_x": -20000.0, "from_y": 0.0, "from_link_id": "1", "to_x": 0.0, "to_y": 0.0, "to_link_id": "20", "departure_time_seconds": 21600.0, "person_id": null}
```

```json
{"travel_time_seconds": 1234.0, "distance_meters": 25000.0, "error": null, "failure_category": null}
```

`person_id` is optional. Unknown links or persons, non-finite coordinates, and negative departure
times produce a response with `error` set instead of closing the connection. A request whose
origin and destination are the same link returns zero time and distance, as MATSim does for
intrazonal trips. Failed responses include `failure_category`: `malformed_request`,
`invalid_request`, `invalid_link`, `missing_person`, `no_path`, or `service_error`.

A response without a `failure_category` key comes from an older `local_qsim`, not from this
version. Clients degrade those to `service_error`, which hides which failures are ordinary
`no_path` answers, so check the binary's build when every failure looks the same.

For `pt` requests that no transit line connects, the transit router falls back to the car router
when one is configured, including for requests without a person. Without a fallback the response
reports the no-path error. See `rust_qsim/tests/resources/equil/equil-config-silo-routing.yml` for a
minimal config used by the integration test. Its network adds an unreachable `island` link to the
equil network, so the tests can produce a `no_path` answer.

## Reanalyze a completed run

A run with `output.analysis.enabled` writes a final-iteration report to `<output_dir>/analysis`. It
covers link volumes and coverage, link classification, per-interval link speeds, vehicle distance
and travel time, free-flow-relative delay, relative-speed profiles, traversal diagnostics, and
en-route agent travel; passenger distance and time are explicitly unavailable without link-level
occupancy. It also covers daily activity patterns — per-person activity and mode chains, observed
activity times with first/last-day censoring reported explicitly, and the reconciliation of a
person's day into activity and travel time — plus the urban-area summary and, when a zone system
is supplied, mode and time zonal OD matrices and zone boundary crossings. An optional
`output.analysis.zone_system` setting maps external link and person IDs to zones; locations it does
not cover are reported as `unmapped` rather than dropped. An optional
`output.analysis.excess_delay_clip_seconds` setting adds clipped positive
delay columns to the CSV exports and metric catalog. See `docs/analysis.md` for allocation and
metric conventions. The `analyze` binary regenerates that report from the
occupancy. An optional `output.analysis.excess_delay_clip_seconds` setting adds clipped positive
delay columns to the CSV exports and metric catalog.

Configuring `output.analysis.accessibility` adds accessibility to supplied opportunities: the
cumulative count of jobs, schools or services reachable from each zone and person within a
configurable travel-time threshold, by mode and departure period, with per-zone, per-person, summary
and map exports. It needs three supplied files — opportunity locations and weights, zone centroids,
and potential-destination travel costs — and stays `unavailable` until all three are configured.
Realized trip durations are never substituted for the supplied costs, so a missing cost leaves the
measure unavailable rather than guessed. See `docs/analysis.md` for the measure, the input formats and
the status conventions. The `analyze` binary regenerates that report from the
run's saved outputs without rerunning QSim:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin analyze -- --run-dir /path/to/output
```

Analysis settings can be changed for the rerun, for example to export narrower intervals:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin analyze -- --run-dir /path/to/output --interval-seconds 1800
```

The same setting applies to an automatic run's interval width via
`--set output.analysis.interval_seconds=1800`.

Setting `output.analysis.person_group_attributes` groups the report by person attributes such as
`income`, `age`, `carAvailability` or `homeZone`, so travel burdens and, against
`output.analysis.comparison_runs`, winner and loser counts are reported per group under a stated
equity criterion. `output.analysis.person_weight_attribute` and
`output.analysis.person_cost_attribute` name the person's weight and monetary cost when the
population supplies them. See `docs/analysis.md` for the group and comparison definitions.

The rerun reads the recorded final iteration, ID store, output network and run metadata. It only
rewrites the analysis outputs; event files, plans, the output network and the ID store are left
untouched. Without `--interval-seconds` the recorded interval width is reused. Link labels, the
urban boundary and the zone system are restored from `manifest.json`, so a rerun reproduces the
recorded classification and geography rather than reporting every link as `unknown` or every
location as `unmapped`.
urban boundary and the accessibility inputs are restored from `manifest.json`, so a rerun reproduces
the recorded classification and accessibility measure rather than reporting every link as `unknown`
and leaving accessibility unavailable. The accessibility inputs themselves are read again from the
recorded paths, so they have to still be present.

The standalone command needs a run that already recorded a report, so run the simulation once with
`output.analysis.enabled: true`. It reads its replay parameters from the run's `analysis/manifest.json`
and `analysis/run_metadata.json` rather than a config file, which keeps a rerun independent of the
run's original inputs and config.

Reports distinguish three states. A completed report in `<output_dir>/analysis` carries
`"status": "complete"` in its `manifest.json`, and its `index.html` presents a completed report. If
a required module fails, the diagnostics -- including their own `index.html` -- are written to
`<output_dir>/analysis-failure` and the completed report is left untouched, so a failed attempt is
never mistaken for a completed one. Rerunning after fixing the inputs republishes the complete
report and removes the failure directory. Optional modules that are not implemented or whose inputs
are not configured are reported as `unavailable` in `module_status.json` rather than failing;
`module_status.json` marks each entry `required` or not. The computed optional modules `link_speed`
and `agent_travel` follow the run's outcome, so a failed run never lists them as complete.

A rerun exits non-zero and logs a diagnostic on failure. If a previous run was interrupted while
publishing, its backup is reclaimed on the next rerun so the last good report is never stranded.

## Create input files

You need to create protobuf files from the xml files. This can be done with the following command:

```shell
cargo run --bin convert_to_binary --release -- --network network.xml --population population.xml --vehicles vehicles.xml --output-dir output --run-id run
```

## RustRover settings

If you use RustRover, you need to disable "Optimize Import". Otherwise, the imports are sorted differently compared to
`cargo fmt`. This is a known
issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RUST-18774/Optimize-import-should-take-into-account-rustfmt-formatting-rules
Hopefully, this will be fixed soon.
